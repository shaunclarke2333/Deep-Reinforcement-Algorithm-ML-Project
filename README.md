# Deep-Reinforcement-Algorithm-ML-Project
Building  a deep neural network and using reinforcement learning to solve the presented problem
Will be solving a cart and pole balancing problem using OpenAI. OpenAI Gym is a tookit for developing and comparing reinforcement learning algorithms that was built by OpenAI, a non-profit artificial intelligence research company founded by Elon Musk and Sam Altman.
